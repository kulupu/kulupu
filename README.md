Kulupu is a pure (no pre-mine, no gadget) proof-of-work blockchain built on the
[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) framework, with support of
on-chain governance and online upgrades. It uses ASIC-resistant mining algorithm
of RandomX.

## Status

The network was launched in September 2019. The first hard fork, code-named
**Slag Ravine** happened in December 2019, at era 0 block 100,000. The second
hard fork, code-named **Swamp Bottom** happened at era 0 block 320,000 on 6th
May 2019.

The current Kulupu blockchain enabled Substrate's balances and governance pallet
modules. Smart contract is a planned but not yet enabled feature, due to
stability concerns.

## Run

You can use the binary build at Kulupu's
[releases](https://github.com/kulupu/kulupu/releases) page.

## Build

### Prerequisites

Clone this repo and update the submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kulupu/kulupu
cd kulupu
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install Rust and required tools:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
./scripts/init.sh
```

Install necessary dependencies. On Ubuntu, run the following:

```bash
sudo apt install -y cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git gcc build-essential clang libclang-dev
```

### Full Node

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Transition from Era 0

If you previously run Era 0 full node, please purge the current block storage
before continue.

```bash
cargo run --release -- purge-chain
```

### Mining

Install `subkey`:

```bash
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate subkey
```

Generate an account to use as the target for mining:

```bash
subkey --sr25519 --network=kulupu generate
```

Remember the public key, and pass it to node for mining. For example:

```
cargo run --release -- --validator --author 0x7e946b7dd192307b4538d664ead95474062ac3738e04b5f3084998b76bc5122d
```

## Proof of Work Parameters

* **Algorithm**: RandomX
* **Block time**: 60 seconds
* **Issurance**: 1 KULU per second (60 KULU per block)
